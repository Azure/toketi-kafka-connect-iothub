# Kafka Connect Source Connector for Azure IoT Hub
________________________

Kafka Connect Source Connector for Azure IoT Hub is a Kafka source connector for pumping data from
[Azure IoT Hub](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/iot-hub/) to [Apache Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/). This
allows getting the telemetry data sent by Azure IoT Hub connected devices to your Kafka installation, so that it can
 then be consumed by Kafka consumers down the stream.

### Configuration

All the configuration settings required to run Kafka Connector for IoT Hub are in the
"[connect-iothub-source.properties](connect-iothub-source.properties)" file. The properties related to Azure IoT Hub
can be obtained from the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com). For more information on how to get the IoT Hub
settings, please refer to the documentation [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-hub/iot-hub-create-through-portal#endpoints) and [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-hub/iot-hub-java-java-getstarted).

Here are the configurable values -

| Config | Value Type | Required | Default Value | Description |
|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|----------------|
| Kafka.Topic | String | Yes |  | This is the topic to which the data will be written to. If the topic exists in Kafka, it will be used, else it will be created. To configure the topic properly (partitions, retention policy, etc.) please use the appropriate [Kafka tools](https://kafka.apache.org/documentation#quickstart_createtopic). |
| tasks.max | Int | Yes |  | Maximum number of tasks that should be created for this connector. More tasks means more parallelism. For optimal performance, this should equal the number of IoTHub partitions. |
| IotHub.EventHubCompatibleName | String | Yes |  | The EventHub compatible name for the IoT Hub. In the Azure Portal, you can find the value under to "IoT Hub" >> your hub >> "Endpoints" >> "Events" >> "Event Hub-compatible name" |
| IotHub.EventHubCompatibleEndpoint | String | Yes |  | The EventHub compatible endpoint for the IoT Hub. In the Azure Portal, you can find the value under "IoT Hub" >> your hub >> "Endpoints" >> "Events" >> "Event Hub-compatible endpoint". |
| IotHub.AccessKeyName | String | Yes |  | The access key name for the IoT Hub. In the Azure Portal, you can find the value under "IoT Hub" >> your hub >> "Shared access policies". You can use the predefined value "service". |
| IotHub.AccessKeyValue | String | Yes |  | The access key for the IoT Hub. In the Azure Portal, you can find the value under "IoT Hub" >> your hub >> "Shared access policies" >> key name >> "Primary key" |
| IotHub.ConsumerGroup | String | Yes |  | The Consumer Group for the IoT Hub. In the Azure Portal, you can find the value under "IoT Hub" >> your hub > "Endpoints" >> "Events" >> Consumer groups. You can use the $Default group or create a new one (recommended) |
| IotHub.Partitions | String | Yes |  | The partition count for the IoT Hub. In the Azure Portal, navigate to "IoT Hub" >> your hub >> "Endpoints" >> "Events" >> "Partitions". |
| IotHub.StartTime | String | No | (Unused if not supplied) | The time from which to start retrieving messages from IoT Hub. The value should be in UTC and in the format yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ssZ. This setting is mutually exclusive with IotHub.Offsets. |
| IotHub.Offsets | String | No | (Unused if not supplied) | The offsets for each IoT Hub partition from which to start retrieving messages from IoTHub, as a comma separated string. For example, for 4 partitions, the value would be something like "abc,lmn,pqr,xyz". This setting is mutually exclusive with IotHub.StartTime. |
| BatchSize | Int | No | 100 | The size of each batch for retrieving messages from IoT Hub. |
| ReceiveTimeout | Int | No | 60 | The max duration in seconds to wait for a full batch when retrieving messages from IoT Hub. |

> Note: If IotHub.StartTime is specified, then the value for IotHub.Offsets is ignored.
> If neither IotHub.StartTime not IotHub.Offsets are specified, then the messages are retrieved from the IoT Hub from
the beginning.

Here is a sample connect-iothub-source.properties file. (Some of these values are not configurable, and hence omitted
  from the list above)
```

```

### Building and running

#### Pre-requisites

* You need to have an Azure IoT Hub from which you want to copy data to Kafka. Get started
  [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-hub/).

* You also need to have Apache Kafka v0.10 installed and running. Get started
[here](https://kafka.apache.org/documentation#quickstart).

#### Steps

Kafka Connect is a generic tool to copy data between Kafka and other systems (like Azure IoT Hub). To copy data from
Azure IoT Hub to Kafka, you need to make the code from this repository available to Kafka Connect and configure it to
use the right Azure IoT Hub and Kafka settings. For more details on using Kafka Connect, you can refer to the
[Kafka Connect user guide](http://docs.confluent.io/3.0.0/connect/userguide.html).

1. Build the source code after cloning this repository using the following command, which will generate a jar file with
all the dependencies embedded in it.
```
sbt assembly
```
Alternatively, you can directly download the jar file for Kafka Connect IoT Hub from [here](https://github.com/Azure/toketi-kafka-connect-iothub/releases/download/v0.6/kafka-connect-iothub-assembly_2.11-0.6.jar).

2. Binplace the jar file in the Kafka installation libs folder (usually under KAFKA_HOME/libs).

3. Update the config file "[connect-iothub-source.properties](connect-iothub-source.properties)" with the appropriate values as described in the section
above. Binplace the file "connect-iothub-source.properties" in the Kafka installation config folder (usually under
  KAFKA_HOME/config).

4. Update the Kafka Connect configuration file ("config/connect-standalone.properties" or
"config/connect-distributed.properties") to point to the Kafka bootstrap servers.

5. Make sure Kafka server and Zookeeper are running, as described
[here](https://kafka.apache.org/documentation#quickstart).

6. Start Kafka connector in
[standalone mode](http://docs.confluent.io/3.0.0/connect/userguide.html#standalone-worker-configuration) to stream data
from IoT Hub to Kafka with the following command from Kafka home -

```
bin/connect-standalone.sh config/connect-standalone.properties config/connect-iothub-source.properties
```
For distributed mode, the connector configuration will stay the same. For the detailed steps on how to do this, please
follow the
[Confluent Kafka Connect documentation](http://docs.confluent.io/3.0.0/connect/userguide.html#distributed-worker-configuration)
on this topic.

### Data format

The data in the IoT Hub is retrieved and pumped into the specified Kafka topic with the following schema. Note that it contains the most relevant properties at the top level (like deviceId, offset, enqueuedTime, sequenceNumber, etc.). While all these properties are set by IoT Hub, contentType needs to be set by the device. The actual payload from the device is contained in the "content" property as a JSON blob. This allows payload with any schema to be copied over to Kafka for consumption downstream.

```json
{
  "schema": {
    "type": "struct",
    "fields": [
      {
        "type": "string",
        "optional": false,
        "field": "deviceId"
      },
      {
        "type": "string",
        "optional": false,
        "field": "offset"
      },
      {
        "type": "string",
        "optional": true,
        "field": "contentType"
      },
      {
        "type": "string",
        "optional": false,
        "field": "enqueuedTime"
      },
      {
        "type": "int64",
        "optional": false,
        "field": "sequenceNumber"
      },
      {
        "type": "string",
        "optional": false,
        "field": "content"
      },
      {
        "type": "map",
        "keys": {
          "type": "string",
          "optional": false
        },
        "values": {
          "type": "string",
          "optional": false
        },
        "optional": false,
        "field": "systemProperties"
      },
      {
        "type": "map",
        "keys": {
          "type": "string",
          "optional": false
        },
        "values": {
          "type": "string",
          "optional": false
        },
        "optional": false,
        "field": "properties"
      }
    ],
    "optional": false,
    "name": "iothub.kafka.connect",
    "version": 1
  }
}
```

## Future work

* Add support to use the schema name in the message in IoT Hub as the topic name. This will allow sending data with
different schemas to their respective topics. (For example, for a device recording and sending temperature and humidity
  data to IoT Hub, the data can be pumped to "temperature" and "humidity" topics respectively, for easier consumption).
